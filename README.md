JavaScript To-Do List
=============================

To-Do List application using pure JavaScript.

Test it here: [https://mokada42991.github.io/JS-To-Do-List/](https://mokada42991.github.io/JS-To-Do-List/)

The user is able to add tasks to the to-do list using the input field at the top of the application. Each task in the list will have two buttons, a "completed" and a "remove" button. The "completed" button will send the task to the "completed" section at the bottom of the list and the "remove" button will delete the task from the list entirely. The tasks will be stored in the browser's local storage and will be rendered upon opening or refreshing the page.
